If you can't code and want to create a mod that does one common, simple thing (such as adding a suit or sound replacement) make sure to check the [Asset Modding APIs](/docs/dev/apis/overview.md#asset-apis) section!

Many common use cases already have APIs that allow you to easily add content without using any code.
