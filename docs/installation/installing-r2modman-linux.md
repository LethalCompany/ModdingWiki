# Using r2modman on Linux and Steam Deck
---

This guide will run you through installing and using [r2modman](https://github.com/ebkr/r2modmanPlus/releases/latest/) to install and play with mods that are available through [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/). Using a mod manager like r2modman allows you to update and play with the latest versions of the mods with ease as the manager does all of that for you!

## Steam Deck Specific Preparation
On Steam Deck you will need to do the following before you can follow this guide:

 - Make sure the game is installed into the internal storage - mods will not load if the game is installed to the MicroSD card.
 - Enter **Desktop Mode** by holding down the power button and selecting Desktop Mode from the menu.

Once you're at the desktop, you're ready to continue!

::: danger
 r2modman does **not** work in Game Mode. Please make sure to read the [**Using Mods in Steam Deck's Game Mode**](installing-r2modman-linux?id=using-mods-in-steam-decks-game-mode) section for a workaround once you've finished with the **Installing r2modman** section.

## Installing r2modman

On Linux, r2modman is available in different package formats depending on your distro:

 - `deb` for Debian and Ubuntu-based distros
 - `pacman` for Arch-based disros
 - `rpm` for distros using the RPM Package Manager (RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, openSUSE, etc.)
 - `AppImage`, a single executable file that can run on most distros - **useful for Steam Deck**

Visit the [**r2modman GitHub releases page**](https://github.com/ebkr/r2modmanPlus/releases/latest/) and download the appropriate package file for your distro and install it according to your package manager's documentation.

**For Steam Deck users,** download the `.AppImage` file and keep it in a safe location such as your Desktop or your Documents folder. You will also need to mark the file as executable. To do this, right-click the `.AppImage` file and select `Properties`. Switch to the **Permissions** tab and check the box marked `Is Executable` and click OK.

After marking the file as executable, you can now double-click the `AppImage` to open r2modman.

That's it! You have just successfully modded Lethal Company!

## Using Mods in Steam Deck's Game Mode
**r2modman will not work in Steam Deck's Game mode, and therefore mods will not load by default.** To get around this, right-click the game in Steam and click `Properties`. From there, paste the following into **Launch Options**:

```
WINEDLLOVERRIDES="winhttp=n,b" %command% --doorstop-enable true --doorstop-target "/home/deck/.config/r2modmanPlus-local/LethalCompany/profiles/Default/BepInEx/core/BepInEx.Preloader.dll" --r2profile "Default"
```
![Steam Properties](/images/r2modman-linux/steamproperties.png)
This will instruct the game to launch with the Default profile we configured in r2modman earlier, so all your mods installed there will be available.

If you'd like to sync your mods with friends, navigate to the [syncing r2modman profiles](syncing-mods) page.
