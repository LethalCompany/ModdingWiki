# Modding APIs Overview

There are two types of API that will be covered in this overview:

- Asset API: An API or custom content mod that can be used without writing any code. Good if you want something simple that even non-programmers can create something with.
- Programming API: A user-created modding API that can be intergrated into your C# Lethal Company mod.

There may be multiple APIs for a single concept, each with their own pros and cons.

APIs marked with a `Gold Star ‚≠ê` have a tutorial on this wiki.

## Asset APIs

### Cosmetics
- [MoreCompany by notnotnotswipez](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/notnotnotswipez/MoreCompany/) has a feature that adds custom cosmetics (hats, badges, etc). You can learn how to create your own through the official [Cosmetic Creation Guide](https://github.com/notnotnotswipez/MoreCompany/wiki/Cosmetic-Creation).

### Custom Suits
- [MoreSuits by x753](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/x753/More_Suits/) allows you to create your own custom ingame suits using only a .png file. [The README](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/x753/More_Suits/) has a basic section on how to format your suit mod for upload.

### Items & Scrap
- [LethalExpansion by HolographicWings](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/HolographicWings/LethalExpansion/) allows you to create your own scrap using a custom Unity SDK. [The SDK's README](https://github.com/HolographicWings/LethalSDK-Unity-Project) has a basic usage tutorial.
