# Modding APIs Overview

There are two types of API that will be covered in this overview:

- Non-code API: An API or custom content mod that can be used without writing any code. Good if you want something simple that even non-programmers can create something with.
- Code API: A user-created modding API that can be intergrated into your C# mod for Lethal Company.

There may be multiple APIs for a single concept, each with their own pros and cons.
