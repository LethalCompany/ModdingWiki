# Modding APIs Overview

There are two types of API that will be covered in this overview:

- Non-code API: An API or custom content mod that can be used without writing any code. Good if you want something simple that even non-programmers can create something with.
- Code API: A user-created modding API that can be intergrated into your C# Lethal Company mod.

There may be multiple APIs for a single concept, each with their own pros and cons.
## Non-code APIs

### Cosmetics
- [MoreCompany by notnotnotswipez](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/notnotnotswipez/MoreCompany/) has a feature that adds custom cosmetics (hats, badges, etc).

### Custom Suits
- [MoreSuits by x753](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/x753/More_Suits/) allows you to create your own custom ingame suits using only a .png file. [The README](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/x753/More_Suits/) has a basic section on how to format your suit mod for upload.

### Sound Modding
