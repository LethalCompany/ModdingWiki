# Frequently Asked Questions

***

## I Installed MoreCompany/BiggerLobby and it doesn't work. {#morecompany-biggerlobby-not-working}

Ensure that:

- You only have EITHER MoreCompany or BiggerLobby installed. Trying to install both will break your game.
- Everybody trying to join the server has the mod installed.
- Everybody trying to join the server has the same mod version installed.

## Do mods work with a pirated version of the game? {#pirating}

Mods will only work on the latest Steam version of Lethal Company. Buy the game.

## Does (X Mod) require everybody to have it installed? {#require-all-to-install}

It depends on the specific mod. Some mods work fully clientside, and some require everybody to have it installed.

When in doubt, assume that a mod will only work if everybody on the server has it installed.
