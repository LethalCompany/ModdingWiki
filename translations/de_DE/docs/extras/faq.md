## Ich habe MoreCompany/BiggerLobby installiert, aber es funktioniert nicht.

Stelle sicher, dass:

- Du ENTWEDER MoreCompany oder BiggerLobby installiert hast. Trying to install both will break your game.
- Everybody trying to join the server has the mod installed.
- Everybody trying to join the server has the same mod version installed.

## Do mods work with a pirated version of the game?

Mods will only work on the latest Steam version of Lethal Company. Buy the game.

## Does (X Mod) require everybody to have it installed?

It depends on the specific mod. Some mods work fully clientside, and some require everybody to have it installed.

When in doubt, assume that a mod will only work if everybody on the server has it installed.
